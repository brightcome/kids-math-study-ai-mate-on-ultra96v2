    "In this tutorial we will train an object detector using the Yolo v4 model. This model will run on Ultra96v2 board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is pretrained on the COCO dataset. The framework used for training is Darknet.\n",
    "Will run through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Install the libraries (Darknet , etc.)\n",
    "*   Clone the github repo and replace the repo training data with your data (from google drive or from own repo - which is faster)\n",
    "*   Train the model on the new images\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make a copy of this tutorial: File-> Save a copy in Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the model training can be run with the repo images of 6 poker cards.If you choose to skip the customization part for your own images just to see how the training and the rest of the steps work."
